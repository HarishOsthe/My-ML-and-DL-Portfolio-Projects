# Board Game Review Prediction Using Linear Regression
Reviews can make or break a product; as a result, many companies take drastic measures to ensure that their product receives good reviews. When it comes to board games, reviews and word-of-mouth are everything. In this project, i have used a linear regression model to predict the average review a board game will receive based on characteristics such as minimum and maximum number of players, playing time, complexity, etc.
