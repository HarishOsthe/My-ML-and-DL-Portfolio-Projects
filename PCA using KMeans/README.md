# Data Compression and Visualization using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) in Python

In this project, i have used K Means clustering on the well known Iris data set, which contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. To visualize the clusters, i used principle component analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of features in the dataset.
